# PythonTools
A collection of Python scripts and utilities developed by Abdullah Alafari to solve practical problems, automate tasks, and share knowledge.

This repository is both a personal archive of my tools and a resource for others. Each script is simple, adaptable, and well-documented, **hopefully** making it easy to understand and reuse.

### About the Tools
Most tools in this repository were originally developed for specific purposes and later generalized for broader applications. The original use case of a script may or may not be disclosed, depending on the specific context and the permission of any associated individuals or entities.

### Current List of Tools:
- **[KML Tag Extractor](KML_Related_Tools/extract_kml_tags_to_text.py)**: Extracts specific tags (like `name` or `coordinates`) from `.kml` files and saves the output as plain text. Useful for summarizing or analyzing geographic data from a given database.

### Warnings:
- **The author is not responsible for any misuse or unintended consequences of these scripts.**
- Some scripts may overwrite files if not configured carefully. Always verify file paths and settings before running.
- Ensure that your input files follow the expected structure or format to avoid errors.
- Test scripts on small data samples or in controlled environments before applying them to critical data.
